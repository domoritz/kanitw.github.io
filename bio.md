#### Names and Family

<!-- what people who now me personally call me-->

My name is *Kanit Wongsuphasawat* or *Ham*. *Kanit* is my formal first name and *Ham* is what people who know me personally call me.
You might wonder, Ham? Yes, *Ham* is actually an English word that means *meat from the upper part of a pig's leg salted and dried or smoked*.  In general, Thai people usually have a short nickname that can be any short Thai, English or Chinese word that might not be related to our first name at all. To give you an example, I have friends who named Jump, Bird, etc.  For my name *Ham*, it is my parent's word play.  My brother name is Muu, which means pig in Thai and Thai people often call Ham(the meat) "Muu-Ham".  So we are "Muu-Ham" brothers. Although I am not a Mandarin speaker, as a Chinese descendant, I also have my Chinese name–黄德镇(Huang-de-zhen).  You might also notice that *Wong* from Wongsuphasawat is actually *Huáng*(黄) in Cantonese[^Huang] because we intentionally hid our Chinese surname in our Thai surname.  Now, you might also notice why this domain is yellowpigz.com. (Huáng means yellow and our names are both related to pig.)

I was born in Bangkok and lived there for 22 years with my [Thai Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Thailand) family.  I am the fifth generation of my family since we first migrated to Thailand.  In Bangkok, our large, warm home consists of 10 people living in the same house–my dad, mom, brother, sister,  grandpa, grandma, auntie, her husband, and their son. 

<!--TODO: Put family picture --> 

My dad and mom are my heroes.  They are pharmacists and entrepreneurs who pioneered the concept of chain drugstores and the usage of vitamin supplements in Thailand.  Besides my dad's work in business, he also currently teaches at Mae-Fah Luang University.  My mom is always cheerful and optimistic.  Although they work hard, they always care about me and support me in what I want to do.  Inspired by my parents, I hope to become an entrepreneur who uses technical knowledge to positively impact the society. 

My brother, [Krist](http://krist.yellowpigz.com]) (Muu), is closest to me in the family.  In some sense, he is also my best friend.  When we were young, we shared every toy and always played together.  We both love soccer and Manchester United.  As we grow up, we share similar interests in Computer and Design.  Actually, he studied Human-Computer Interaction too.  We are also close to our little sister, Nicha, too.  We often take a picture of three of us and joke people that we are actually triplets. 

<!--TODO: Put trio picture -->

I am also very close to my grandparents.  When I was in primary school, my grandpa always taught us English and Math after school.  That certainly provided me with a strong fundamental knowledge.  My grandma is also a great chef.  While I am in the United States, her food is one of the things I miss the most.  

We are proud to be Thai.  Meanwhile, we also preserve many parts of [Teochew/Chaozhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaozhou) Chinese culture.  Every year, dozens of our extended family members, including my grandparents' siblings and their children celebrate Chinese New Year together.  We also love to have <!--find better word--> our traditional [Teochew Cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_cuisine).  If you can find a good Teochew restaurant here in the US, I will treat you to a meal!

#### Childhood: Lego, Computers, Design and Computers!

I did my formative studies at [Assumption College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_College_(Thailand) in Bangkok from grades 1 to 12.  I remembered, everyday after my grandpa's tuition, I played Lego with my brother and tried to build new stuff from those magical bricks everyday.  

<!--I also liked Scrabble and I won the Primary School league in the National Scrabble Championship[^Scrabble].-->
<!--TODO: Put kiddy picture -->

After Lego, the computer had become our main toy when my dad bought our first computer, mainly for his work.  Within a short period, he had to buy another computer as we always occupied it.  However, his plan did not work since both computers became occupied all the time instead–one by me and one by my brother.  As a result, my dad had to buy a third computer and another one a few years later after my sister started to occupy the third one.  While most of our friends enjoyed Nintendo 64 and subsequently Sony Playstation consoles, our toys were always computers.  We never bought any console after we had our first computer.  Also, as we had so many computers, my friends often joked that my home was Wongsuphasawat Computer Center when they visited.

My interests in design and technology emerged in my grade 7, when I followed my brother to join the school's Graphic and Internet club, in which I learned how to use Photoshop and HTML to design websites.  After two wonderful years with the club, I joined our Olympic in Informatics Club (ACIOI[^ACIOI]), a club right next door, in which I enjoyed using programming and algorithms to solve [programming challenges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming).  It was as fun as playing games. Before I really noticed, I was selected to joined the National Olympiad in Informatics camp for two consecutive years in Grade 10 and 11. I was also named an alternative national candidate for the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).  Meanwhile, I still developed my love for design.  My dissatifcation with the design of the school's memorial book in grade 9, which I had led, motivated me to improve my design skills.   When I headed the [design of my school's yearbook](/project/acyearbook.md) again in grade 12, this time our design had a professional quality.

#### College life at Chulalongkorn University

With love for programming and design, I hoped to study Computer Engineering and Product Design.  However, undergraduate interdisciplinary education was largely limited in Thailand so I can only chose one.  I finally entered the Computer Engineering[^ComEng] program at Chulalongkorn University.

One small creation I am proud during my undergraduate study was my Calculus solution guide.  As I was good at Math during high school, a lot of my college friends bugged me to teach them Calculus during the first year.  Well, teaching them all one by one was not a feasible solution.  Thus, I neatly wrote my solution when I worked on the exercise problems from the textbooks and just let my friends photocopied it to use as solution guide.  In our freshman Calculus classes, besides the lecture, students were left to study on their own without either teaching assistant or problem solving guide.  Thus, my guide (in fact, more like scracth paper) became widely popular especially in the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science.  A week before the freshmen exam, I even had to carry several copies of this solution guide to distribute to my friends. Hundreds of people owned copies of it during my freshman year and over a thousand people have used it to date.[^thousand]  This also helped me to know a lot of new friends.  

Studying only theoritical subjects get me bored.  Meanwhile, it is very popular in Thailand that ..

Programming and algorithm experience from the Olympiad camp helped me to excel during my undergraduate study and enabled me to be active in extracurricular activities.  One of my best memories was being a member of Chulalongkorn University Photography Club.  Every year, 

Moreover, my friends and I also formed wonderful<!--TODO find better word--> teams to compete in local Software competitions and built software like [Vidview](/project/vidview.html) and [FaceSpot](/project/facespot.html]).  I also joined [Plasma-Z team](/project/plasmaz.html) in the Robot Club to develop soccer robots system and competed in the [International Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/).  These projects helped me not only learn even more than from the classes but also discover my passion in the making technology for people.  Even in the Robotic club where I supposed to design Robotic system, one of the things that intrigued me the most was designing UI for our team members to test the system easily and more effectively.  Another good thing about these projects is if you did well, then you have a chance for free trips abroad.  I have been to Singapore, Malaysia and Austria as results from these activities.  (Thanks to my smart teammates that made all these happened!)

My perspective of the world has completely changed when I joined the [Stanford Thai Exchange Program (STEP)](http://www.stanford.edu/group/thais/cgi-bin/step/home.php) in 2008.  Although, the program was just three weeks, I am inspired by the entrepreneurial spirits and energy of people in Stanford and Silicon Valley.  Those experience included visiting tech companies like Google, Facebook, and attending Stanford's [Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Seminar](http://etl.stanford.edu/). I also remembered that one of my STEP host was doing part-time jobs and went to two student clubs meeting at night before coming back home to study.  STEP brought me home passion and the idea of coming back to Stanford for graduate studies always sticked in my mind.  Back then, the idea did not seem feasible as I had never heard of any alumni of my Computer Engineering department has been admitted to Stanford.  

Right after my undergraduate thesis presentation, I had ten days to apply for the Fulbright Scholarship.  I knew that I wanted to be a person who bridge the technology to people. So I was deciding between  Computer Science with focus in Human-computer Interaction and Engineer Management.  Both looked great for my bringing technology to people goal. Within that short time, I chose Engineering Management simply because Stanford's Engineering Management(MS&E) program is flexible enough to take a number of design and HCI courses.[^HCI]

I was fortunated to win the Fulbright Scholarship and went through writing graduate schools application and taking the torturing GRE tests.  Finally, my dream came true.  I am admitted to Stanford University.  Thank you. 

#### Fulbright scholar and Stanford University

However,

[First quarter took a HCI course with Scott Klemmer and it was so much fun so that I keep taking HCI and d.school courses and start involving in HCI Research including in Calming Technology and the Hot-topic, Massive Online Courses. 

[Thanks to the flexibility to MS&E program, I was able to experiment and iterate my study plan.]  
 



Thank you so much for reading.  I hope this help you know me more.  After reading all of this long bio, please feel free to shoot me an email to ask questions or comment.  

[^Huang]: See more about [variations of Huang's romanization as a surname](http://bit.ly/huang-surname).
[^ACIOI]: ACIOI was an acronym for Assumption College International Olympiad in Informatics.  We included "International" in the name is because our club was so successful at having members winning medals from the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).
[^Scrabble]: To be precise, it is actually the National Crossword Championship.  Scrabble is called *Crossword* in Thailand probably due to license issue.
[^Chinese-Thai]: By saying Chinese-Thai, I am not ethnically mixed blood.  Most of my ancestry lines are rooted from China but since our family lives in
[^ComEng]: Computer Engineering programs in Thailand are very similar to Computer Science program in United States.  Most universities also often have Computer Science department in Faculties of Science but Computer Engineering programs are more popular. (In Thailand, we adopted British system and call use the term "Faculty of Science" rather than "School of Science")
[^thousand]: Given that there are over 300-600 hundred people using my guide each year since 2006, it is definitely over a thousand.  In 2011, I did a fun experiment creating a [Facebook Fan Page for the guide](http://www.facebook.com/hamcalculus) without really promoting it but it has earned over 700 likes and also some thank you posts. 
[^HCI]: In hindsight, actually most HCI master's program are also flexible as well.  But I did not know back then.
