<!-- more about Bangkok -->


My name is *Kanit Wongsuphasawat* and my nickname is *Ham*. ([Why?](/bio/names-faqs.html))  I was born in Bangkok and lived there for 22 years with my Thai [Teochew Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Thailand) [family](/bio/family.html).  

[I'm studying Human-computer Computer Interaction]

<!--I love food and I am lucky that both Thai and Teochew food are awesome.  
 If you can take me to a good Teochew restaurant here in the US, I will treat you to a meal!-->


##### Childhood: Lego, Computers, Design and Computers!

I did my formative studies at [Assumption College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_College_(Thailand) in Bangkok from grades 1 to 12.  I remembered I played Lego with my brother and tried to build new stuff from those magical bricks everyday after school. 
After Lego, we became so obsessed with computer that my dad had to buy a lot of computers and subsequently my friends often joke that my home is actually [Wongsuphasawat Computer Center](/bio/computer-center.html).

<!--I also liked Scrabble and I won the Primary School league in the National Scrabble Championship[^Scrabble].-->
<!--TODO: Put kiddy picture -->


My interests in design and technology emerged in my grade 7, when I followed my brother to join the school's Graphics and Internet club, in which I learned how to use Photoshop and HTML to design websites.
I then became interested in a club right next door, the Olympic in Informatics Club (ACIOI[^ACIOI]), which I subsequently joined and learned how to use programming and algorithms to solve programming challenges <!--[]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)-->.  It was as fun as playing games. Before I really noticed, I was selected to joined the National Olympiad in Informatics camp for two consecutive years in Grade 10 and 11. <!--I was also named an alternative national candidate for the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).-->  Meanwhile, I still developed my love for design and headed the [design of my school's yearbook](/project/acyearbook.md).

##### College life at Chulalongkorn University

With love for programming and design, I hoped to study Computer Engineering and Product Design.  However, undergraduate interdisciplinary education was largely limited in Thailand so I can only chose one.  I finally entered the Computer Engineering[^ComEng] program at Chulalongkorn University.

Prior programming experience from the Olympiad camp gave me a lot of free times for extracurricular activities including joining [Photography Club](/bio/cuphoto.html), taking [Charcoal Drawing Class](/bio/drawing.html), and authoring [a Calculus Solution Guide](/bio/calculus-guide.html). 
Moreover, my friends and I also formed a number of<!--TODO find better word--> teams to compete in local Software competitions and built software like [Vidview](/project/vidview.html) and [FaceSpot](/project/facespot.html]).  I also joined [Plasma-Z team](/project/plasmaz.html) in the Robot Club to develop soccer robots system and competed in the [International Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/).  These projects helped me not only learn even more than from the classes but also discover my passion in the making technology for people.  Even in the Robotic club where I supposed to design Robotic system, one of the things that intrigued me the most was designing UI for our team members to test the system easily and more effectively.  

Another good thing about these projects is if you did well, then you have a chance for free trips abroad.  I went to Singapore, Malaysia and Austria as my rewards.  Moreover, I had also joined the [Stanford Thai Exchange Program (STEP)](http://www.stanford.edu/group/thais/cgi-bin/step/home.php) in 2008.  Although, the program was just three weeks, I am very inspired by the entrepreneurial spirits and energy of people in Stanford and Silicon Valley.  Those experience included visiting tech companies like Google, Facebook, and attending Stanford's [Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Seminar](http://etl.stanford.edu/). After STEP, the idea of coming back to Stanford for graduate studies always sticked in my mind.  

Right after my undergraduate thesis presentation, I had ten days to apply for the Fulbright Scholarship.  I knew that I wanted to become a person who can bridge the gap between technology and people. So I was deciding between  Computer Science with focus in Human-computer Interaction and Engineer Management (with focus on Entrepreneurship).  Both looked great for my goal. Within that short time, I chose Engineering Management simply because Stanford's Engineering Management(MS&E) program is flexible for taking courses in other department[^HCI] and, more importantly, I felt that I should study something different from my elder brother, who was doing a PhD in Human-computer Interaction.

##### Fulbright scholar and Stanford University

I was fortunated to win the Fulbright Scholarship and went through writing graduate schools application while working full-time at Thomson Reuters.  Finally, my dream came true.  I was admitted to Stanford University. 


[First quarter took a HCI course with Scott Klemmer and it was so much fun so that I keep taking HCI and d.school courses and start involving in HCI Research including in Calming Technology and the Hot-topic, Massive Online Courses. 

[Thanks to the flexibility to MS&E program, I was able to experiment and iterate my study plan.]  
 



Thank you so much for reading.  I hope this help you know me more.  After reading all of this long bio, please feel free to shoot me an email to ask questions or comment.  


[^ACIOI]: ACIOI was an acronym for Assumption College International Olympiad in Informatics.  We included "International" in the name is because our club was so successful at having members winning medals from the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).
<!--[^Scrabble]: To be precise, it is actually the National Crossword Championship.  Scrabble is called *Crossword* in Thailand probably due to license issue.-->
<!--[^Chinese-Thai]: By saying Chinese-Thai, I am not ethnically mixed blood.  Most of my ancestry lines are rooted from China but since our family lives in-->
[^ComEng]: Computer Engineering programs in Thailand are very similar to Computer Science program in United States.  Most universities also often have Computer Science department in Faculties of Science but Computer Engineering programs are more popular. (In Thailand, we adopted British system and call use the term "Faculty of Science" rather than "School of Science")
[^HCI]: In hindsight, actually most HCI master's program are also flexible as well due to its interdisciplinary nature.  But I did not know back then.
