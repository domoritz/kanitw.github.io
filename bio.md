### Personal Bio

My name is Kanit Wongsuphasawat or Ham.  *Kanit* is my formal first name and *Ham* is how people who know me personally call me. (Why Ham?) Although I am not a Mandarin speaker, as a Chinese descendant, I also have my Chinese name–黄德镇(Huang-de-zhen).  You might also notice that *Wong* from (Wongsuphasawat) is actually Huang(黄) in Cantonese.  My grandparents intentionally hid our Chinese surname into our Thai surname. :)

I was born in Bangkok in 1988 and lived there for 22 years with my warm Chinese-Thai family.  My parents were pharmacists and bootstrapping entrepreneurs who pioneered the usage of vitamins supplement in Thailand.  I am in the fifth generation of a family that migrated to Thailand.  We still retain many parts of Chaozhou Chinese culture, like many other Chinese-Thai people.
