My interests in education and online work led me to work with  Professor Saberi and Venture Lab team to design the user interface of Venture-Lab, the first team-based Massive Open Online Course platform (MOOC).

<!-- What challenges?  What qualities of your design -->

Venture lab has been covered in *Forbes* and *Stanford News*. Professor Chuck Eesley has also written about the project's success stories on his [blog](http://eesley.blogspot.com/).  Our first class had over 80,000 students from roughly 150 countries.

<!--Over 120 teams has completed .....-->
