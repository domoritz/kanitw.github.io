My interests in education and online work led me to work with  Professor Saberi and Venture Lab team to design user interface of Venture-Lab, the first team-based Massive Online Open Course(MOOC).

Venture lab has been covered in Stanford news and Forbes. Professor Chuck Eesley has also written about the project's success stories on his [blog](http://eesley.blogspot.com/).  Our first class has total around 80,000 students from over 150 countries and 120 final project submissions.
