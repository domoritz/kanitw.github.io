Online education is changing the world's education landscape.  Since February 2012, I worked with Professor Saberi and Venture Lab team, to develop Venture-lab, the first project-based Massive Online Open Classes(MOOC) as a Research assistant, User Experience and Interaction Designer for the project.

Our first class in Entrepreneurship, taught by Professor Chuck Eesley from Stanford, has total around 80,000 students from over 150 countries and 120 final project submissions.  This autumn, we are launching 5 classes including Entrepreneurship, Startup Board, A Crash Course on Creativity, Finance, Designing a New Learning Environment.

Venture lab has been covered in Stanford news, Forbe. Professor Chuck Eesley has also written about the project's success stories on his [blog](http://eesley.blogspot.com/).
