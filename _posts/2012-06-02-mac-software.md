As have just got my new personal Macbook Pro and MacPro at work, I think it’s pretty useful to have a note for what I install in my Macs.  (I also included some useful web tools.)  Of course, I think these are best software in OSX.

### GENERAL STUFFS

These need to be downloaded manually:

*   **VLC** – for open various video files
*   **Flip4Mac**
*   **Growl** – for many notification
*   **Dropbox** & **Google Drive** – for syncing files
*   **NTFS Write support** – very important if you have NTFS hard drives – read this [blog][1]

These are easily downloaded via AppStore

*   **Unarchiver**
*   **CoBook** – better address book, (*Killer Feature: *able to sync with Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.)
*   **Sparrow** - for quick email checking (sadly, they joined google and stops their apps’ development.)
*   **Mail **- Apple’s Mail app.  (works much better with gmail if you set easy shortcut key to “archive” and “flag” (eq. to star on Gmail).  I use F1 for archive and F2 for Flag.
*   **Fluid App **- Create Application file for your favorite web apps like Gmail, Asana 
    *   Use http://iconverticons.com to create icons for an app you like!

### Browsers

*   **Chrome** – is my #1 browser ([My List of Plugins][2])
*   **Firefox** – for rendering some web that’s bad in Chrome and, of course, for testing.

### PRODUCTIVITY/UTILITY TOOLS

*   from AppStore 
    *   **iSnap** – help me snaps windows (like Window’s Aura interface)
    *   **Alfred** – help me Launch Apps faster * (Quicksilver)
    *   **Time Out Free** – help me break from work and be calm!
*   **Direct D/L** 
    *   Evernote
    *   Skitch – quick annotate & screen capture (also by Evernote)
*   **[Finder Addons][3]**

### DESIGN

*   **Apple iWork** – Page and Keynote, apart from a good office software, are amazing tools for prototyping!
*   **OSX’s system ColorPicker** 
    *   [Script][4] for ColorPicker Direct access (from [Robinwood.com][5])
    *   plugin for Mac’s ColorPicker (put in /Library/ColorPickers) 
        *   **[hexpicker][6]**
        *   **Mondrianum** – for getting themes from kuler.com (obsoleted but can still be downloaded from [here][7])
    *   [Create one from image][8] is also pretty useful
    *   Other image tools 
        *   
*   **[Colorhexa][9]** – not an app but useful tool for picking colors

### DEVELOPER TOOLS

*   **Sublime Text 2** – one of the best free text editor on mac (I can definitely say it’s the best cross platform one), support TextMate’s script as well! (*Killer Feature: *[List of plugins I use][10])
*   **iTerm2**- better terminal replacement 
    *   Put [CdTo][11] with iterm2 plugin in your finder!
    *   Pick color theme from[ color theme gallery][12].
*   **[DTerm][13]** - integrate command line with finder
*   **[Git][14]** 
    *   **SourceTree** – Great Tool for git (Much better than gitx!)
*   zsh – very powerful shell
*   **CHMViewer** – for Seeing CHM Help files
*   **CSSEdit**
*   XCode (Optional)
*   **Eclipse** (Optional)
*   **Dash** (AppStore) – (*Killer Feature: * quick documentation offline, create quick snippet that will incredibly save your time!)
*   **Cyberduck** – Quick FTP
*   **Sequel Pro **- for browsing Database instance
*   **LatexIt **- good for quick creating screenshot for Mac.

* I used Quicksilver in the past but Alfred provide better simple function although it’s not free for premium function and I have not tried its premium feature yet.
