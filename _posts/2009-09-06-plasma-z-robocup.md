As part of Engineering Innovator Club, our Plasma-Z team designs small size soccer robot to compete in the International Robocup.

I led the software dev. team in 2009, co-developed tactical systems and initiated using software configuration management system in the project.

After months of development and testing, we got 3rd place in the International Robocup 2009.
