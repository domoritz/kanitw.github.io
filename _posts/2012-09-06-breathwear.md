In Spring 2012, I worked with Stanford University's [Calming Technology Lab](http://calmingtechnology.org/) to research on using breathing drill to improve calmness.  

With supervision from Neema Moraveji, the Calming Technology Lab founder, I implemented a breathing drill using visual guide and auditory guide based on the lab's Breathware system.  We did a user study to compare the effect of using these two different modalities for breathing regulation. 

Finally, our poster and extended abstract are accepted into [ACM UIST 2012](http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2012/)'s poster session.
