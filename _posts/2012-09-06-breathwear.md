One problem that always intrigues me is how might we use technology to induce positive behavioral change?

In this project, I collaborated with the Stanford Calming Technology Lab and focused on user interfaces to help people relieve stress.
As respiratory regulation can reduce stress and increase parasympathetic tone, I designed and implemented an application using a visual guide and an auditory guide based on the Labâ€™s Breathwear system.

From a user study, we discovered that audio guide led to higher self-reported calm ratings but the visual guidance led to more respiratory change.  We concluded that motivating users to exert physical or mental efforts may counter the calming effects of slow breathing and designers of calming technologies must acknowledge the discrepancy between mechanical slow breathing and experiential calm in designing future systems.  The result has been presented at UIST2012.

<!-- ### Abstract

Interactive systems are increasingly being used to explicitly support change in the user's psychophysiological state and behavior. One important trend in this vein is systems that support calm breathing habits. We designed and evaluated techniques to support respiratory regulation to reduce stress and increase parasympathetic tone. Our study revealed that auditory guidance was more effective than visual at creating self-reported calm. We attribute this to the users' ability to effectively map sound to respiration, thereby reducing cognitive load and mental exertion. Interestingly, we found that visual guidance led to more respiratory change  but less subjective calm. Thus, motivating users to exert physical or mental efforts may counter the calming effects of slow breathing. Designers of calming technologies must acknowledge the discrepancy between mechanical slow breathing and experiential calm in designing future systems. -->
