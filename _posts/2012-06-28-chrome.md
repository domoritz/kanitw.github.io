Here is a list of plugins I use to enhanced my Chrome browser:

*   Google Dictionary – open dictionary quickly when browsing the web (just doubleclick on words you like)
*   RSS Subscription (by Google)
*   FastestChrome – a lot of useful helpers
*   QuickTab – just like Alfred/Quicksilver for tabs in Chrome.
*   … (more soon!)
