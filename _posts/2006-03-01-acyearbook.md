For 12 years from grade one to twelve, Assumption College had studied together.  One of the common memories they have is to carry this uniform school bag everyday.   As a lead graphic designer, I decided to impose this bag images on the protective case of the yearbook to represent our 12-year memories.  We also designed the graphic of the yearbook using minimalist design principle.
