In the Data Visualization course with Prof. Heer at Stanford, I tried to utilize text visualization techniques and multiple coordinated views to help instructors understand peer reviews in the massive online open courses.

Since Peer reviews is one possible solution for scaling assessment of open-ended assignment in massive online courses but the amount of data from peer make it difficut for teaching staff to explore and understand the review data, Peereviz can help instructors understand pattern in the peer evaluation process in the online courses.
