Addition and subtraction play a crucial
role in mastering advanced math
concepts such as algebra.  However
Learning math through tons of text is too
boring, abstract and ineï¬€ective for kids.
Kinetic Math use the gesture-based
interface of Microsoft Kinect to teach kids
addition via a kinesthetic, visual and
engaging game.
