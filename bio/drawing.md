While I did pretty well in my freshman year, studying only theoritical subjects get me bored.  So I and one of my best friend, Billy went to an Art school to study Charcoal Drawing.  

I remembered we were talking about how many of our friends practiced playing guitars to sing songs for their girls, so maybe we could master drawing and draw pictures for girls too.  Although we later discovered that Charcoal drawing was extremely difficult and we did not have enough time to master it, it was just memorable that we were two unorthodox engineering students who carried drawing board around the engineering school.
