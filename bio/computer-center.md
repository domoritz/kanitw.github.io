After Lego, Computer had become my brother and my main toy when my dad bought our first computer, originally for his work.  Within a short period, he had to buy another computer as we always occupied it.  However, his plan did not work since both computers became occupied all the time insteadâ€“one by me and one by my brother.  As a result, my dad had to buy a third computer and another one a few years later after my sister started to occupy the third one.  While most of our friends enjoyed Nintendo 64 and subsequently Sony Playstation consoles, our toys were always computers.  Also, as we had so many computers, my friends often joked that my home was Wongsuphasawat Computer Center when they visited.
