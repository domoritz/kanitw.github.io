One of my best memories was being a member of Chulalongkorn University Photography Club.  Every year, we had a trip to National parks and take pictures of flowers and landscapes.  We also liked taking portrait pictures.  In one of our trips, we wore jacket suites to take pictures in a corn field like a rockstar.
