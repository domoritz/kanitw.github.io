### Why do you have two names?  and Why Ham?

Well, *Kanit* is my formal first name and *Ham* is what people who know me personally call me. And yes, *Ham* is actually an English word that means *meat from the upper part of a pig's leg salted and dried or smoked*.  

In general, Thai people usually have a short nickname that can be any short Thai, English or Chinese word that might not be related to our first name at all. To give you an example, I have friends who named Jump, Bird, etc.  For my name *Ham*, it is my parent's word play.  My brother's nickname is Muu, which means pig in Thai and Thai people often call Ham(the meat) "Muu-Ham".  So we are "Muu-Ham" brothers. 

### Oh, your also have Chinese name?

Yes as a Chinese descendant, I also have my Chinese name–黄德镇(Huang-de-zhen).  You might also notice that *Wong* from Wongsuphasawat is actually *Huáng*(黄) in Cantonese[^Huang] because we intentionally hid our Chinese surname in our Thai surname.  Now, you might also notice why this domain is yellowpigz.com. (Huáng means yellow and our names are both related to pig.)

### Why does Thai people's surname so long?
