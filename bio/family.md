In Bangkok, my large, warm family consists of 10 people living in the same houseâ€“my dad, mom, brother, sister,  grandpa, grandma, auntie, her husband, and their son. 
I am the fifth generation of my [Thai Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Thailand) family since we first migrated to Thailand.

My dad and mom are my heroes.  They are pharmacists and entrepreneurs who pioneered the concept of chain drugstores and the usage of vitamin supplements in Thailand.  Besides my dad's work in business, he also currently teaches at Mae-Fah Luang University.  My mom is always cheerful and optimistic.  Although they work hard, they always care about me and support me in what I want to do.  Inspired by my parents, I hope to become an entrepreneur who uses technical knowledge to positively impact the society. 

My brother, [Krist](http://krist.yellowpigz.com]) (Muu), is closest to me in the family.  In some sense, he is also my best friend.  When we were young, we shared every toy and always played together.  We both love soccer and Manchester United.  As we grow up, we share similar interests in Computer and Design.  Actually, he studied Human-Computer Interaction too.  We are also close to our little sister, Nicha, too.  We often take a picture of three of us and joke people that we are actually triplets. 

I am also very close to my grandparents.  When I was in primary school, my grandpa always taught us English and Math after school.  That certainly provided me with a strong fundamental knowledge.  My grandma is also a great chef.  While I am in the United States, her food is one of the things I miss the most.  

[TODO: Take care of the following flow.]

We are proud to be Thai.  Meanwhile, we also preserve many parts of [Teochew/Chaozhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaozhou) Chinese culture.  Every year, dozens of our extended family members, including my grandparents' siblings and their children celebrate Chinese New Year together.  We also love to have <!--find better word--> our traditional [Teochew Cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_cuisine).
