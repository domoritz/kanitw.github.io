One small creation I am proud during my undergraduate study was my Calculus solution guide.  As I was good at Math during high school, a lot of my college friends bugged me to teach them Calculus during the first year.  Well, teaching them all one by one was not a feasible solution.  Thus, I neatly wrote my solution when I worked on the exercise problems from the textbooks and just let my friends photocopied it to use as solution guide.  In our freshman Calculus classes, besides the lecture, students were left to study on their own without either teaching assistant or problem solving guide.  Thus, my guide (in fact, more like scratch paper) became widely popular especially in the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science.  A week before the freshmen exam, I even had to carry several copies of this solution guide to distribute to my friends. Hundreds of people owned copies of it during my freshman year and over a thousand people have used it to date.[^thousand]  

This also helped me to know a lot of new friends.  


[TODO tell about Facebook fan page!]

[^thousand]: Given that there are over 300-600 hundred people using my guide each year since 2006, it is definitely over a thousand.  In 2011, I did a fun experiment creating a [Facebook Fan Page for the guide](http://www.facebook.com/hamcalculus) without really promoting it but it has earned over 700 likes and also some thank you posts.
