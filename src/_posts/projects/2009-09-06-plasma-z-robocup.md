Soccer is the most popular sport for humans. It is also the most popular sport for robots as well–at least at the International Robocup!

As part of the Plasma-Z team, I led the development of our robotic software system. This system integrated inputs from computer vision and motion control feedback system to generate real-time strategies and command fast-paced small size soccer robots.  Besides developing game playing strategies, I introduced user interfaces that allow easy calibration and testing of our system. In addition, I have also initiated using software configuration management system in the project to manage complexities in our system.
