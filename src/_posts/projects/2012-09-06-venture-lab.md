Online education is changing the world’s education.  Besides lectures and quizzes, project-based learning is also influential.  Venture Lab was built to bring project-based and collaborative learning to the online education world.  

I led the early User Interface Design of Venture-lab in 2012. We introduced algorithmic team matching and peer reviews system in online education.  The peer review system has enabled the assessment of massive scale online classroom.

Venture lab has been covered in [Forbes]() and [Stanf](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/september/venture-lab-platform-091712.html)[ord News](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/january/seelig-online-creativity-012213.html). Our first class in Entrepreneurship had over 50,000 students.  One final project eventually received funding from a venture capital.
