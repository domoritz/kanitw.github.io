Online education is changing the world’s education landscape.  Besides lectures and quizzes, project-based learning is also an influential experience in school.  Venture Lab was built to bring project-based learning to the online education world.  

I led the User Interface Design of Venture-lab, the first project-based Massive Online Open Classes. We have introduced algorithmic team matching and peer reviews system in online education.  The peer review system has enabled the assessment of massive scale online classroom.

Venture lab has been covered in *Forbes* and *Stanford News*. Our first class in Entrepreneurship had over 50,000 students.  One final project eventually received funding from a venture capital.
