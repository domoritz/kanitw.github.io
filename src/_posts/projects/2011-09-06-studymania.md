Students need motivation to study.  Our goal was to provide a simple way for students to create fun challenges by betting against their friends.
As part of CS147 (Intro to Human Computer Interaction & Design) course, our team conducted the whole design process: from needfinding, alternative generation, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, rapid prototyping and user testing.
As a result, Studymania provides a simple way to create fun way to engage students in learning. This competitive settings drive users to study hard and get stuff done in order to beat their friends.
