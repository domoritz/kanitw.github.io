Today I’m working on a private project on Github.

Github has recently improved their issue tracker.  Quite handy although it still lacks certain feature–like prioritization, severity–and some ui issues like lacking keyboard shortcut for repetitive workflow.  (They do have some keyboard shortcut but certain features like labeling doesn’t have appropriate short key yet.)

For prioritization and severity, the obvious workaround is creating “high-priority/severity”, “medium…”, “low” labels.

However, putting image screenshot in the issue is still lacking.

One great solution is using Skitch, which allows us to quickly annotate screenshots and upload to the web.  G33klaw.com has post an article about it here.

  
In addition to the technique given, we can also use [dash][1] (or any other text expander) to save our effort typing markdown syntax since Skitch only give us the Url.  This is my script (mss = markdown screenshot)
