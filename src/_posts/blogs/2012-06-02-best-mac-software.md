As have just got my new personal Macbook Pro and MacPro at work, I think it’s pretty useful to have a note for what I install in my Macs.  (I also included some useful web tools.)  Of course, I think these are best software in OSX.

## GENERAL STUFFS

These need to be downloaded manually:
- **Growl** – for many notification

- **Dropbox & Google Drive** – for syncing files

- **NTFS Write support** – very important if you have NTFS hard drives – read this blog

- **VLC** – for opening various video files

- **Flip4Mac**
These are easily downloaded via AppStore
Unarchiver
CoBook – better address book, (Killer Feature: able to sync with Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.)
Sparrow - for quick email checking (sadly, they joined google and stops their apps’ development.)
Mail - Apple’s Mail app.  (works much better with gmail if you set easy shortcut key to “archive” and “flag” (eq. to star on Gmail).  I use F1 for archive and F2 for Flag.
Fluid App - Create Application file for your favorite web apps like Gmail, Asana
Use http://iconverticons.com to create icons for an app you like!
Browsers

Chrome – is my #1 browser (My List of Plugins)
Firefox – for rendering some web that’s bad in Chrome and, of course, for testing.
PRODUCTIVITY/UTILITY TOOLS

from AppStore
iSnap – help me snaps windows (like Window’s Aura interface)
Alfred – help me Launch Apps faster * (Quicksilver)
Time Out Free – help me break from work and be calm!
Direct D/L

Mondrianum – for getting themes from kuler.com (obsoleted but can still be downloaded from here)

Colorhexa – not an app but useful tool for picking colors
DEVELOPER TOOLS

Sublime Text 2 – one of the best free text editor on mac (I can definitely say it’s the best cross platform one), support TextMate’s script as well! (Killer Feature: List of plugins I use)
iTerm2- better terminal replacement
Put CdTo with iterm2 plugin in your finder!
Pick color theme from color theme gallery.
DTerm - integrate command line with finder
