While I am just going to start my PhD program, I might not be the best person to answer this question yet. 

However, since I have done some homework before deciding to spent my next many years (hopefully not more than 5 years), in a graduate schools.  I believe the following blog posts are particularly useful for anyone who is considering doing a PhD, especially in Computer Science.  (They are not really well ordered.)
