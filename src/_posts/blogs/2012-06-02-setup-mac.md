Setting up a new computer takes time since we need to put all great tools and configs into the computer.  Having a list is useful and here is my list.

## OSX Settings

- **Mouse Setting** - Go to System Preference > Trackpad - then enable "Tap to click" and "3 Finger Drag"
- **Show Hidden Files**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**–One great thing about mac setting is you
- **alt** – alt + - = –, alt + = = ≠, alt + < = ≤, alt + > = ≥

## Quicklook

- **Quicklook Plugins** – help your mac's quicklook able to quick look more type of files.  See [GigaOm](http://gigaom.com/2009/05/06/four-useful-quicklook-plugins/)


#### Design

### Mail 

- **Mail** - Apple’s Mail app. Some people like it over Sparrow  It works much better with gmail if you set easy shortcut key to “archive” and “flag” (eq. to star on Gmail).  I use F1 for archive and F2 for Flag.
Colorhexa – not an app but useful tool for picking colors


### I want to try

- setting up *zsh* sheel

- Pick color theme from color theme gallery.


Please feel free to recommend if you have any cool tool/apps suggestion.  I will keep updating this list!
