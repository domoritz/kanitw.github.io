   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A large ratio of students per teacher in the massive online courses introduces difficulties for the assessment of students’ work especially for open ended assignments. Peer review is one possible solution for scaling assessment of open-ended assignments in massive online courses. However, the amount of data from the peer review system makes it difficult for teaching staff to explore and understand the review data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peereviz utilized existing text visualization techniques as well as multiple coordinated views to explore the massive scale of data in the peer review system of massive online courses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;I led the User Interface Design of Venture-lab, the first project-based Massive Online Open Classes. We have introduced algorithmic team matching and peer reviews system in online education. The peer review system has enabled the assessment of massive scale online classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture lab has been covered in &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stanford News&lt;/em&gt;. Our first class in Entrepreneurship had over 50,000 students. One final project eventually received funding from a venture capital. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One problem that has always intrigued me is how might we use technology to induce positive behavioral change? As respiratory regulation can reduce stress and increase parasympathetic tone, my colleague and I designed an application using a visual guide and an auditory guide based on the Stanford Calming Technology Lab’s Breathwear system. We did a user study to compare the effect of using these two different modalities for breathing regulation. We discovered that the audio guide led to higher self-reported calm ratings but the visual guidance led to more respiratory change. We concluded that motivating users to exert physical or mental efforts may counter the calming effects of slow breathing. The result has been presented at UIST2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our &lt;a href='/assets/breathwear/poster_final.pdf'&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2012/CantForceCalmUIST2012.pdf'&gt;extended abstract&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ### Abstract

Interactive systems are increasingly being used to explicitly support change in the user's psychophysiological state and behavior. One important trend in this vein is systems that support calm breathing habits. We designed and evaluated techniques to support respiratory regulation to reduce stress and increase parasympathetic tone. Our study revealed that auditory guidance was more effective than visual at creating self-reported calm. We attribute this to the users' ability to effectively map sound to respiration, thereby reducing cognitive load and mental exertion. Interestingly, we found that visual guidance led to more respiratory change  but less subjective calm. Thus, motivating users to exert physical or mental efforts may counter the calming effects of slow breathing. Designers of calming technologies must acknowledge the discrepancy between mechanical slow breathing and experiential calm in designing future systems. --&gt;</content>

As part of CS147 (Intro to Human Computer Interaction &amp;amp; Design) course, our team conducted the whole design process: from needfinding, alternative generation, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, rapid prototyping and user testing. As a result, Studymania provides a simple way to create fun way to engage students in learning. This competitive settings drive users to study hard and get stuff done in order to beat their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soccer is the most popular sport for humans. It is also the most popular sport for robots as well–at least at the International Robocup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Plasma-Z team, I led the development of our robotic software system. This system integrated inputs from computer vision and motion control feedback system to generate real-time strategies and command fast-paced small size soccer robots. Besides developing game playing strategies, I introduced user interfaces that allow easy calibration and testing of our system. In addition, I have also initiated using software configuration management system in the project to manage complexities in our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidview enabled JavaME phone users to watch videos from Youtube and other Video service providers by having intermediary server to prime the video format before sending to the phones. With Vidview, video could be watched from anywhere and anytime.
